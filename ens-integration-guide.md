# What Is ENS and Why Should You Care?

Think about how annoying it is to share your super long and messy crypto wallet address—something like 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4020C6. It’s hard to remember and easy to mess up.

Now imagine if you could just say, “Send it to enobiee.eth” — simple, clean, and easy to remember.

That’s exactly what ENS (Ethereum Name Service) does. It’s like giving your crypto wallet a friendly username, making Web3 feel as easy as sending an email.

Here’s a quick comparison:

Email address: enobiee@gmail.com instead of a complicated IP address like 172.217.14.109

ENS domain: enobiee.eth instead of a long wallet address like 0x1234abcd...

**What You’ll Need to Get Started**

Must-Haves:

A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

Some ETH (Ethereum) — usually around $20-$100 depending on fees and domain length

A basic understanding that you’re dealing with real money, and transactions are permanent


No Need For:

Technical expertise or crypto experience (I’ll guide you through!)

Fancy or expensive hardware


Step 1: Set Up Your Crypto Wallet

MetaMask Is the Easiest Way to Start

1. Head over to MetaMask.io — make sure it’s the official site!


2. Click “Download” and pick your browser.


3. Install the MetaMask extension.


4. Open it and choose Create a New Wallet (don’t import one yet).


5. Write down your 12-word recovery phrase on paper — this is very important!



Important: These 12 words are your wallet’s key. Lose them, and you lose access forever. Share them with no one.


Add Some ETH to Your Wallet

You can buy ETH directly inside MetaMask, or

Buy ETH on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance, then transfer it to your MetaMask wallet.


Aim to have enough ETH to cover domain costs plus transaction (gas) fees — usually a bit extra as a buffer.


Step 2: Head to the ENS App

1. Visit app.ens.domains (the official ENS platform).


2. Click “Connect” to link your MetaMask wallet.


3. Approve the connection when MetaMask pops up.



You’ll see your wallet address at the top right — you’re connected!

Step 3: Find Your Perfect Domain

Think about what you want—your name, your brand, or a nickname.

Examples: john.eth, mycafe.eth, cryptomom.eth

Shorter names cost more:

3 letters: about $640/year

4 letters: about $160/year

5 or more: around $5/year



Tips:

Longer names save money.

Pick something easy to spell and remember.

Check if the same .com exists if you want to keep branding consistent.


Type your desired name into the search box — green means available, red means taken. If your choice isn’t free, try a different version!

Step 4: Register Your Domain

When you’ve found your name:

1. Select how many years you want to register (1 to 10).


2. Review the total price (registration + gas fees).


3. Click “Request to Register.”



ENS registration happens in two steps to keep your domain safe:

Step 1: Commit — a hidden request to prevent front-running (pay gas fees here).

Step 2: Reveal — show the domain you want and pay registration + gas fees.


Follow the prompts and confirm transactions in MetaMask. After a few minutes, the domain is yours!

Step 5: Set Up Your Domain

Link It to Your Wallet

1. Go to your domain management page.


2. Under “Records,” set the ETH address to your wallet.


3. Save and confirm.



Add Profile Info (Optional but Cool!)

You can add:

Profile picture (avatar)

Bio or description

Twitter, GitHub, email, website links


Just add or edit records and confirm changes.

Set Reverse Resolution

This step makes apps show your ENS name instead of the long wallet address.

Go to the “More” tab in your domain settings.

Click “Set Primary ENS Name” and confirm.



---

Step 6: Try It Out!

Send a small amount of ETH to your new ENS domain (like yourname.eth) instead of your wallet address and see it arrive.

Check your ENS name on sites like etherscan.io to track transactions.

Share your new Web3 identity confidently!

Watch Out For These Common Mistakes

Don’t rush your domain choice — you’re paying for multiple years!

Gas fees can be high—try to register when the network isn’t busy.

Don’t close your browser during registration.

Always set reverse resolution so your ENS name shows properly.

Keep your recovery phrase safe.

Remember to renew your domain before it expires.



---

Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

Transaction failed? Try again with higher gas fees or wait for a less busy time.

Domain shows as taken but available? Someone may have just grabbed it—try alternatives.

ENS name not showing in apps? Set reverse resolution in your settings.

High gas fees? Use sites like ethgasstation.info to find cheaper times.



---

What Next?

Use your ENS name everywhere in Web3 profiles.

Create subdomains for different uses (work.yourname.eth).

Host a decentralized website or set up email forwarding.

Participate in ENS governance.

Keep your wallet secure — maybe get a hardware wallet for larger amounts.

FAQs

Can I sell my ENS domain?

What if I don’t renew?
It expires and becomes available for others.

Can I use it beyond crypto?
Absolutely! Point it to websites, social profiles, and more.

As long as you keep your wallet and renew the domain, yes.

Final Thoughts

Getting your first ENS domain is like staking your claim in the decentralized web. It might feel a bit technical at first, but millions have done it successfully by following steps like these.

Take your time, double-check everything, and if you get stuck, the ENS community on Discord is super helpful.

Welcome to Web3 — your new digital identity awaits!
